# SRE-Load-Balancer

## Overview

Test change for pipeline trigger.

SRE-Load-Balancer is an industry-grade load balancing solution designed specifically for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams. It addresses modern challenges in application scalability, reliability, and observability, providing robust features for traffic management, failover, and performance optimization in large-scale distributed systems.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Traffic Distribution:** Automatically balances incoming requests across multiple backend servers using advanced algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted, etc.).
- **Health Checks & Auto-Failover:** Continuously monitors backend health and reroutes traffic away from unhealthy nodes to ensure high availability.
- **Scalability:** Supports horizontal scaling for cloud-native and on-premise environments.
- **Observability & Metrics:** Integrates with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time metrics, logging, and alerting.
- **Security:** Implements SSL/TLS termination, DDoS protection, and access controls.
- **Configuration Management:** Declarative configuration via YAML/JSON for easy automation and CI/CD integration.
- **API & CLI:** Provides RESTful APIs and command-line tools for management and automation.

## SRE Use Cases

- **Reliability:** Ensures zero-downtime deployments and seamless failover, reducing MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery).
- **Performance Optimization:** Distributes load efficiently to prevent bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization.
- **Incident Response:** Real-time health checks and alerting enable rapid detection and mitigation of failures.
- **Capacity Planning:** Provides traffic analytics for forecasting and scaling decisions.
- **Automation:** Integrates with infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD pipelines for automated rollouts and configuration changes.

## Modern Load Balancing Challenges Solved

- **Microservices & Containerization:** Supports service discovery and dynamic backend registration for Kubernetes/Docker environments.
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments:** Handles traffic across multiple cloud providers and on-premise data centers.
- **TLS Offloading & Security:** Centralizes SSL/TLS management and protects against common attack vectors.
- **Observability:** Exposes detailed metrics and logs for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Self-Healing:** Automated failover and recovery mechanisms minimize manual intervention.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+ recommended)
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- Go/Python/Node.js (specify based on your implementation)
- Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahi-saurabh/SRE-Load-Balancer.git
cd SRE-Load-Balancer
# Follow setup instructions for your language/runtime
```

### Configuration

Edit the configuration file (`config.yaml` or `config.json`) to define backend servers, health check intervals, and load balancing strategy.

### Running

```bash
# Example command to start the load balancer
./load-balancer --config config.yaml
```

### Monitoring

Integrate with Prometheus by enabling metrics endpoint in the configuration. Visualize metrics in Grafana dashboards.
