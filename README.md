# SRE-Load-Balancer

## Overview

SRE-Load-Balancer is an industry-grade load balancing solution designed for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams. It solves modern challenges in application scalability, reliability, and observability, providing robust features for traffic management, failover, and performance optimization in large-scale distributed systems.

This project enables:
- Automated traffic distribution across backend servers
- Real-time health checks and auto-failover
- Seamless integration with monitoring and CI/CD tools
- Secure and scalable deployments for cloud-native, hybrid, and on-premise environments


## Key Features

- **Dynamic Traffic Distribution:** Balances incoming requests using algorithms like Round Robin, Least Connections, and Weighted strategies.
- **Health Checks & Auto-Failover:** Monitors backend health and reroutes traffic from unhealthy nodes for high availability.
- **Scalability:** Supports horizontal scaling for cloud-native and on-premise environments.
- **Observability & Metrics:** Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics, logging, and alerting.
- **Security:** SSL/TLS termination, DDoS protection, and access controls.
- **Configuration Management:** Declarative YAML/JSON configuration for automation and CI/CD integration.
- **API & CLI:** RESTful APIs and command-line tools for management and automation.


## SRE Use Cases

- **Reliability:** Zero-downtime deployments and seamless failover reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery).
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient load distribution prevents bottlenecks and optimizes resource usage.
- **Incident Response:** Real-time health checks and alerting enable rapid detection and mitigation of failures.
- **Capacity Planning:** Traffic analytics support forecasting and scaling decisions.
- **Automation:** Integrates with infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD pipelines for automated rollouts and configuration changes.


## Modern Load Balancing Challenges Solved

- **Microservices & Containerization:** Service discovery and dynamic backend registration for Kubernetes/Docker environments.
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments:** Traffic management across multiple cloud providers and on-premise data centers.
- **TLS Offloading & Security:** Centralized SSL/TLS management and protection against common attack vectors.
- **Observability:** Detailed metrics and logs for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Self-Healing:** Automated failover and recovery minimize manual intervention.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+ recommended)
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- Go/Python/Node.js (choose based on your implementation)
- Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahi-saurabh/SRE-Load-Balancer.git
cd SRE-Load-Balancer
# Follow setup instructions for your language/runtime
```

### Example Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
backends:
	- address: 10.0.0.2:80
		weight: 2
	- address: 10.0.0.3:80
		weight: 1
health_check:
	interval: 10s
	path: /health
load_balancing: round_robin
metrics:
	enabled: true
	port: 9100
ssl:
	enabled: true
	cert_file: /path/to/cert.pem
	key_file: /path/to/key.pem
```

### Running

```bash
# Example command to start the load balancer
./load-balancer --config config.yaml
```

### Usage Example

Suppose you have two web servers running at `10.0.0.2:80` and `10.0.0.3:80`. With the above configuration, requests will be distributed using the round robin algorithm, and unhealthy servers will be automatically excluded from the pool.

You can monitor metrics at `http://localhost:9100/metrics` and visualize them in Grafana.

### Monitoring

Enable the metrics endpoint in your configuration. Add the Prometheus scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
	- job_name: 'sre-load-balancer'
		static_configs:
			- targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Import the provided Grafana dashboard to visualize traffic, health checks, and performance.
